## Notes

* Each day represents 5-20h of work for a student.
* Google and the command `man` are you best friends.
* It's hard but it's normal, it's the everyday life of a developer. There are no shortcuts.
* At no point the goal will be to learn a language. The goal is to learn to learn new concepts. Learning languages is not the hard part, it will come naturally.
* Hello it's Luke here
